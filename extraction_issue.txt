UPDATE: The issue is that existing tools in the database were created with the old prompts that instruct them to generate identifierId fields with 'col_XXXX' format.

These tools need to be regenerated without the identifierId field in their output.

The extraction functions should only return:
- extractedValue
- validationStatus  
- aiReasoning
- confidenceScore
- documentSource

The identifierId should be generated at database save time, not by the extraction function.
