This provides a clear framework for the product specifications, meeting the requirement. High confidence due to explicit sections defining the service and its performance standards."

It covers payment due dates (4.1), the subscription model based on End User tiers and adding users (4.2), and the handling of taxes (4.3). The structure is explicitly and clearly defined.

Remedies for non-conformance are also provided (correct the service or terminate and refund). This, combined with the 'Service Level Addendum' mentioned in Section 2.1, provides clear quality standards and remedies. High confidence due to explicit warranty and remedy clauses."

Business continuity for a SaaS platform is addressed through the 'Service Level Addendum' (referenced in Section 2.1) and the 'Data Security Standards' (referenced in Section 2.5), which cover service availability and data protection, respectively.

It is further supported by the 'Confidentiality' section (Section 6) and the 'Indemnification' section (Section 8), which covers IP infringement claims.

Section 5.4 specifies a 30-day period for data export post-termination, followed by data deletion procedures. The provisions are clear and favorable.

A full review of the document reveals no clauses allowing the customer to audit Asana's compliance, security, or other records. Therefore, this requirement is not met. High confidence based on the absence of an audit rights clause for the customer."
