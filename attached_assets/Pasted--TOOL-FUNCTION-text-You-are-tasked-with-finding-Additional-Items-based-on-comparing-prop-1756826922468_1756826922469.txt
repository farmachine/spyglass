=== TOOL FUNCTION ===
```text
You are tasked with finding "Additional Items" based on comparing properties within the provided `Data`. Your primary goal is to extract and CREATE NEW records of items that appear in one list of records but are MISSING a corresponding property in another column within the same record. This is NOT a record linkage or mapping task. You are creating entirely NEW records.

Your output MUST be a JSON ARRAY of objects, where each object represents a newly extracted item. Each object in the array MUST have the following keys:

*   **extractedValue**: (String) The actual extracted data representing the "Additional Item". This should be the value of the item you're extracting.
*   **validationStatus**: (String) Either "valid" or "invalid". Set to "valid" if you are confident in the extractedValue. Set to "invalid" if you have any doubts or low confidence.
*   **aiReasoning**: (String) A brief explanation of the logic used to extract the `extractedValue`. Explain why you believe it is an "Additional Item" based on the data in `Data`.
*   **confidenceScore**: (Integer) A numerical representation of your confidence in the extracted `extractedValue`, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest).
*   **documentSource**: (String) A clear reference to the source document or page within `Data` where the `extractedValue` was found.

Remember, `Data` is provided for REFERENCE ONLY to understand the context and determine what "Additional Items" to extract. DO NOT attempt to link or map to any existing records within the database. Each extracted item should be treated as a new, independent record to be CREATED.

Return multiple extracted items as a single JSON array, ordered as they appear in the source document.

For example:
[{"extractedValue": "result1", "validationStatus": "valid", "aiReasoning": "explanation1", "confidenceScore": 95, "documentSource": "source1"}, {"extractedValue": "result2", "validationStatus": "valid", "aiReasoning": "explanation2", "confidenceScore": 90, "documentSource": "source2"}]
```

=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENT ===
Each item in the list above has an "identifierId" field. You MUST:
1. Include the EXACT SAME "identifierId" in your response for each item
2. Return results in ANY order, but each result MUST have its corresponding identifierId
3. The identifierId links the extracted value to the correct row/record
4. Example: If input has {"identifierId": "abc-123", "Column Name": "Date"}, 
   your output MUST include {"identifierId": "abc-123", "extractedValue": "..."}
