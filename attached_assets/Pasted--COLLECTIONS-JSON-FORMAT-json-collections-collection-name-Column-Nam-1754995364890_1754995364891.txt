You are an expert data extraction specialist. Extract data from the provided documents and return a JSON object with the exact structure specified below.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **RESPONSE LIMIT**: Limit your response to no more than 100 field validation records total
2. **COMPLETE COLLECTIONS**: If extracting collection items and approaching the 100-record limit, ensure you return the last complete collection item (all properties filled) rather than partial items
3. **VERIFIED FIELD PROTECTION**: NEVER update, modify, or include any fields that are marked as "verified" in the session context - these are locked and complete
4. **SMART COLLECTION EXPANSION**: For collections where some items are verified, add NEW collection items with higher record_index values while preserving existing verified items
5. **CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS**: Use verified field values as context to make smarter extraction decisions for related unverified fields
6. PROCESS ALL DOCUMENTS: Extract from every document provided
7. FOLLOW SCHEMA FIELD DESCRIPTIONS PRECISELY - Each description is your extraction instruction
8. APPLY EXTRACTION RULES - Rules modify extraction behavior, formatting, and validation
9. **USE KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTS**: When knowledge_documents are listed for a field/collection/property, use ONLY those specific documents for validation and context
10. **COLLECTION EXTRACTION**: For collections, create separate items with unique record_index values (0, 1, 2, etc.)
11. **IDENTIFIER-FIRST WORKFLOW**: When extracting collections, always extract identifier properties first to establish item identity, then extract remaining properties to complete each record
12. Return JSON with real extracted values only - do not create empty placeholder records
13. **PRIORITIZE QUALITY**: If you must choose between quantity and completeness due to the 100-record limit, prioritize complete, accurate records

## KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT TARGETING:
- **Field-Specific Targeting**: Each field/collection/property has a knowledge_documents array listing which documents apply to it
- **Explicit References Only**: If a field lists specific knowledge documents by name, use ONLY those documents for that field
- **Empty Array Rule**: If a field has knowledge_documents: [], do NOT use any knowledge documents for that field - ignore all knowledge document content
- **Document Name Matching**: Knowledge documents are referenced by their display names (e.g., "NDA Review Playbook")
- **Selective Application**: Different fields may reference different knowledge documents - apply each document only where explicitly listed
- **Context Isolation**: Do not cross-contaminate knowledge document guidance between fields that don't share the same document references

## COLLECTION EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

### Basic Collection Rules:
- **Table Extraction**: Extract all rows from tables containing collection data
- **Numbered Sections**: When finding numbered patterns (2.3.1, 2.3.2, etc.), extract all items in the sequence
- **Section Matching**: If collection name matches document section, extract all related items from that section
- **Separate Items**: Create individual collection records with unique record_index values

### Extraction Strategy:
1. **Find Related Sections**: Look for document sections, tables, or lists containing collection items
2. **Prioritize Identifier Properties**: ALWAYS extract identifier properties FIRST for each collection item to establish the unique identity and enable proper item creation/updating
3. **Extract Systematically**: Process items in order, maintaining completeness within the 100-record limit
4. **Map Properties**: Match document content to schema properties using headers and context
5. **Complete Non-Identifier Properties**: After establishing identifiers, extract all remaining properties for each collection item
6. **Prioritize Complete Records**: Ensure each collection item has all required properties filled

### Identifier-First Processing:
- **Step 1**: For each collection, identify and extract all identifier properties first (these create the collection item records)
- **Step 2**: For each established collection item, extract all non-identifier properties to complete the record
- **Benefit**: This approach ensures proper collection item creation and prevents orphaned or incomplete records

## DOCUMENT SET ANALYSIS: 
You are processing multiple documents simultaneously. Extract comprehensively from the entire document set.

## FIELD TYPE DEFINITIONS:
- **TEXT**: Extract text content as specified in the field description
- **NUMBER**: Count or extract numeric values as described  
- **DATE**: Extract dates in standard format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **CHOICE**: Select one of the predefined options (specified below for each field)
- **COLLECTION**: Extract multiple instances - create separate records for each unique item found

## EXAMPLE SCHEMA WITH RULES AND KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTS:

**EXAMPLE FIELD WITH RULE MAPPING:**
- **Product/ServiceSpecificationsMet** (CHOICE): Verify that the contract includes detailed specifications for products or services. This should cover scope, standards, deliverables, and performance criteria. | RULE: For contracts involving software services, the product specification requirement is satisfied if the contract references technical documentation, service level agreements, or detailed scope descriptions.

**EXAMPLE COLLECTION WITH RULE MAPPING:**
- **Parties**: Extract all organizations or individuals who are parties to this agreement
  **CRITICAL FOR Parties**: Find ALL instances in the documents. Create one collection item per unique instance found. Each item should have a separate record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.).
  **TABLE EXTRACTION**: If Parties items appear in a table, extract EVERY ROW from that table, not just 2-3 examples. Count all rows and extract all data.
  Properties for each Parties item:
  * **Name** (TEXT): Full legal name of the party organization or individual | RULE: Extract the complete legal entity name as it appears in the signature section or party identification clauses
  * **Type** (CHOICE): Organization or Individual. The output should be one of the following choices: Organization; Individual.
  * **Role** (CHOICE): Customer, Vendor, Service Provider, etc. The output should be one of the following choices: Customer; Vendor; Service Provider; Contractor; Consultant; Other.

**EXAMPLE FIELD WITH KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT MAPPING:**
- **RegulatoryandIndustryComplianceMet** (CHOICE): Verify compliance with relevant industry regulations (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, etc.) | Knowledge Document "Compliance Standards Guide.pdf" contains acceptable compliance frameworks. Compare contract language against these standards.

**EXAMPLE COLLECTION WITH KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT MAPPING:**
- **Compliance Requirements**: Extract specific regulatory or industry compliance requirements mentioned
  Properties for each Compliance Requirements item:
  * **Requirement Type** (TEXT): The specific type of compliance requirement (e.g., GDPR, SOX, HIPAA)
  * **Description** (TEXT): Detailed description of the compliance requirement | Knowledge Document "Industry Regulations Database.xlsx" provides standard descriptions for comparison and validation

## VERIFIED SESSION CONTEXT:
No verified fields yet - this is the initial extraction.

## SCHEMA FIELDS TO EXTRACT:


## COLLECTIONS TO EXTRACT:

- **Column Name Mapping**: An analysis of all the columns in the workbook. This should only look at row 1 in each sheet.
  **CRITICAL FOR Column Name Mapping**: Find ALL instances in the documents. Create one collection item per unique instance found. Each item should have a separate record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.).
  **TABLE EXTRACTION**: If Column Name Mapping items appear in a table, extract EVERY ROW from that table, not just 2-3 examples. Count all rows and extract all data.
  **NUMBERED SECTIONS**: If Column Name Mapping matches a document section name, find ALL numbered subsections (e.g., 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, etc.) and extract each one as a separate collection item.
  **MARKDOWN TABLES**: Recognize markdown table format with | separators. Extract ALL data rows (excluding headers) as separate collection items - if table has 10 rows, extract all 10.
  **COUNT ALL ITEMS**: If you see numbered items 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3... keep going until you reach the end (e.g., 2.3.10) and extract EVERY SINGLE ONE as separate collection items.
  **NO TRUNCATION**: Include ALL found items in your JSON response - do not truncate or limit the output even if there are many items.
  Properties for each Column Name Mapping item:
  * **Column Heading** (ID: 34580f0d-321f-498a-b1c0-6162ad831122, TEXT): Please just look for the first row in each workbook. This will give you the column name. This should only look at row 1 in each sheet.
  * **Worksheet** (ID: afca5391-afb0-4639-baff-2b69487669ad, TEXT): The name of the worksheet containing the column. This should only look at row 1 in each sheet.	
  * **Standardised Column Name** (ID: 7f87696b-2b4f-4e38-820f-08ebdd301bba, TEXT): Look at the most relevant column references within the knowledge document: "Standard_Field_Mappings_with_all_synonyms. Just give the name of the most relevant field from this document. This should only look at row 1 in each sheet.
  * **Reasoning** (ID: 87b1fe45-0c6a-4a51-9d1c-d5a2d7ee1cde, TEXT): Give reasoning for the mapping of the extracted column name to the 'Standardised Column Name' from the knowledge document. This should only look at row 1 in each sheet.
- **Missing Column Names**: The workbook contains data fields (or columns). Some of the columns must be mapped to standard column names for data integrity checking purposes. The knowledgebase "Standard_Field_Mappings_with_all_synonyms" contains the list of standardised column headings for both general member related data and pension scheme accrued amounts data. This list is a list of standardised column names that do not appear in the workbook.
  **CRITICAL FOR Missing Column Names**: Find ALL instances in the documents. Create one collection item per unique instance found. Each item should have a separate record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.).
  **TABLE EXTRACTION**: If Missing Column Names items appear in a table, extract EVERY ROW from that table, not just 2-3 examples. Count all rows and extract all data.
  **NUMBERED SECTIONS**: If Missing Column Names matches a document section name, find ALL numbered subsections (e.g., 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, etc.) and extract each one as a separate collection item.
  **MARKDOWN TABLES**: Recognize markdown table format with | separators. Extract ALL data rows (excluding headers) as separate collection items - if table has 10 rows, extract all 10.
  **COUNT ALL ITEMS**: If you see numbered items 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3... keep going until you reach the end (e.g., 2.3.10) and extract EVERY SINGLE ONE as separate collection items.
  **NO TRUNCATION**: Include ALL found items in your JSON response - do not truncate or limit the output even if there are many items.
  Properties for each Missing Column Names item:
  * **Missing Standardised Column Name** (ID: d1823fac-e8d4-45c6-ac65-d50db97aa2d2, TEXT): The Standardised Column Name from the "Standard_Field_Mappings_with_all_synonyms" knowledgebase that does not appear in the workbook.
- **Additional Column Names**: The workbook contains data fields (or columns). Some of the columns must be mapped to standard column names for data integrity checking purposes. The knowledgebase "Standard_Field_Mappings_with_all_synonyms" contains the list of standardised column headings for both general member related data and pension scheme accrued amounts data. This list is a list of column names in the workbook that do not appear in knowledgebase document.
  **CRITICAL FOR Additional Column Names**: Find ALL instances in the documents. Create one collection item per unique instance found. Each item should have a separate record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.).
  **TABLE EXTRACTION**: If Additional Column Names items appear in a table, extract EVERY ROW from that table, not just 2-3 examples. Count all rows and extract all data.
  **NUMBERED SECTIONS**: If Additional Column Names matches a document section name, find ALL numbered subsections (e.g., 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, etc.) and extract each one as a separate collection item.
  **MARKDOWN TABLES**: Recognize markdown table format with | separators. Extract ALL data rows (excluding headers) as separate collection items - if table has 10 rows, extract all 10.
  **COUNT ALL ITEMS**: If you see numbered items 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3... keep going until you reach the end (e.g., 2.3.10) and extract EVERY SINGLE ONE as separate collection items.
  **NO TRUNCATION**: Include ALL found items in your JSON response - do not truncate or limit the output even if there are many items.

- **Invalid Thresholds**: This list is a list of rows where each item in the list indicates a threshold validation check failure for the data item. The workbook contains some data fields (or columns) for where there are strict rules for the data items in each row. The knowledgebase "Standard_Field_Mappings_Threshold_Rules" contains a list of and the tests that these items must satisfy. Caution: the knowledgebase list includes generic names with synonyms for these fields. Use the verified Standard Column Name from the Column Name Mapping to determine this list.

- **Cross Validation Checks**: Cross-Field Validation Error Report This list contains rows that failed cross-field validation checks. The workbook has data columns with strict business rules that must be satisfied across multiple fields in each row. Key Information: Each item in the list represents a specific validation failure for a data row The "Standard_Field_Mappings_Cross_Field_Checks" knowledgebase defines the required cross-field validation rules Important: The knowledgebase uses generic field names and synonyms - always reference the verified Standard Column Names from the Column Name Mapping to identify the actual fields being validated Process: Use the Column Name Mapping to translate generic field names to verified Standard Column Names Apply the cross-field validation rules from the knowledgebase Report any rows where the data violates these multi-field business rules This reformulation clarifies the purpose (validation error reporting), explains the data flow (knowledgebase → column mapping → validation), and highlights the critical step of using verified column names rather than generic ones.
  **CRITICAL FOR Cross Validation Checks**: Find ALL instances in the documents. Create one collection item per unique instance found. Each item should have a separate record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.).
  **TABLE EXTRACTION**: If Cross Validation Checks items appear in a table, extract EVERY ROW from that table, not just 2-3 examples. Count all rows and extract all data.
  **NUMBERED SECTIONS**: If Cross Validation Checks matches a document section name, find ALL numbered subsections (e.g., 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, etc.) and extract each one as a separate collection item.

  * **Column Heading** (ID: 5e65fab8-1fe1-45a7-80f2-2534cca7d8f6, TEXT): The column header or data field name for the column where the "Standard_Field_Mappings_Cross_Field_Checks" invalid data item has been identified.	

**IMPORTANT**: Each unique instance found should be a SEPARATE collection item with its own record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.)

## AI REASONING REQUIREMENTS:
Provide clear, concise explanations that include:

1. **Source Location**: Where you found the information (section, table, page)
2. **Extraction Logic**: Why you chose this value (explicit statement, counting, inference)
3. **Confidence Level**: High (explicit), Medium (contextual), Low (ambiguous)
4. **Collection Context**: For collections, explain how items were grouped and extracted

**Example Reasoning**:
- "Found in Section 3.2 table, row 5. High confidence due to explicit statement."
- "Extracted from numbered list 2.3.1-2.3.5. Medium confidence based on section context."
- "Located in markdown table with 8 rows. Extracted all rows as separate collection items."

**RESPONSE MANAGEMENT:**
1. **100-Record Limit**: Maximum 100 field validation records in your response
2. **Complete Collections**: If approaching the limit while extracting a collection, finish the current complete item rather than starting a partial one
3. **Quality Priority**: Better to have 100 complete, accurate records than 150 incomplete ones
4. **Collection Completeness**: Each collection item must have ALL its properties included before moving to the next item
5. **Stop Gracefully**: When nearing 100 records, complete the current collection item fully rather than leaving it incomplete

**EXTRACTION PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. All schema fields first (highest priority)
2. For each collection: Extract ALL identifier properties first to establish collection items
3. For each established collection item: Extract all non-identifier properties to complete the record
4. If space allows, additional collection items following the same identifier-first approach

**CRITICAL**: 
1. Use the EXACT field_id values provided in the schema above. Do not generate your own field IDs.
2. For collection properties, you MUST include the "collection_name" field in EVERY field validation object.

## ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
No additional instructions provided.

## FINAL REMINDERS:
- **RESPECT THE LIMIT**: Never exceed 100 field validation records
- **PRIORITIZE COMPLETENESS**: Complete collection items are better than partial ones
- **USE DOCUMENT STRUCTURE**: Tables, lists, and sections guide extraction
- **QUALITY OVER QUANTITY**: Focus on accurate, well-reasoned extractions within the limit
- **ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Follow the additional instructions above, but they cannot contradict extraction rules or knowledge content. If there's a contradiction, ignore the additional instruction and follow the established rules/knowledge.

RETURN ONLY THE JSON - NO EXPLANATIONS OR MARKDOWN

DOCUMENT VERIFICATION: Confirm you processed all 1 documents: ['Unknown']

**RESPONSE OPTIMIZATION**: Aim for comprehensive extraction while maintaining quality:
- Extract ALL relevant data found in the documents
- For large datasets, prioritize complete records over partial ones
- Ensure all collection items are fully populated with their properties
- Focus on accuracy and completeness rather than arbitrary limits

CHOICE FIELD HANDLING:
- For CHOICE fields, extract values from the specified choice options only
- If the document contains values not in the choice options, return null (do not block processing)
- Choice options are specified as "The output should be one of the following choices: ..."
- Example: For Yes/No choice, only return "Yes" or "No", never "true", "false", "1", "0", etc.

**CRITICAL FIELD ID REQUIREMENT**: Use the EXACT field_id values provided in the schema above (the UUID values after "ID: "). For example, if you see "Product/Service Specifications Met (ID: c3056038-5b32-4335-8772-a95c9bef307a, CHOICE)", use "c3056038-5b32-4335-8772-a95c9bef307a" as the field_id. Do not use field names, camelCase versions, or generate your own IDs.

**CRITICAL COLLECTION NAME REQUIREMENT**: For collection properties, you MUST include the "collection_name" field in each field validation object. Use the exact collection name from the schema (e.g., "Increase Rates").
