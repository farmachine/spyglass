📝 AI EXTRACTION PROMPT:
================================================================================
=== TOOL FUNCTION ===
Your task is to identify items that are MISSING from the input data.
LOGIC:
1. Scan the Reference Document for all available items/fields/columns
2. Check if each item from the Reference Document exists in the input Data
3. If an item appears in the Reference Document but NOT in the input Data, it is MISSING
4. Create a record for each MISSING item
IMPORTANT:
- You are looking for items that exist in the Reference Document but are ABSENT from the input Data
- If an item is in the input Data, it is NOT missing (don't create a record for it)
- Only create records for items found in the Reference Document that are NOT in the input Data
For each missing item found, explain in aiReasoning why it's considered missing (e.g., "Found 'EmployeeID' in the reference document but it does not appear in the input data list").
