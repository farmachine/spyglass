### 1. Issue Analysis
The current function is failing because there is a fundamental mismatch between how the function expects to receive the Excel file and how the testing environment provides it. The function is designed to open an Excel file from a file path using `pandas.ExcelFile()`. However, the test result shows that the `Excel File` input parameter is not a path, but a single, large string containing the entire text content of the workbook. This text is formatted with custom delimiters like `=== Sheet: [SheetName] ===` to separate worksheets.

Additionally, the function's argument for the column names is `Column_Name` and it expects a simple list, while the input parameter is named `Columns` and is a structured data object. The current code does not correctly access the list of column names from this object.

As a result, the `pandas` library cannot parse the string input, causing the function to fail and return an incorrect output. The test result shows a dump of the raw inputs instead of the expected JSON mapping column names to sheet names.

### 2. Root Cause
The root cause is twofold:

1.  **Incorrect File Handling:** The function's code relies on the `pandas` library to read a physical Excel file (`.xlsx`, `.xls`). It is not equipped to parse a plain text string that represents the file's content. The `pd.ExcelFile(Excel_File)` call fails when `Excel_File` is the raw text content instead of a valid file path.
2.  **Incorrect Input Parameter Processing:** The code expects a simple list of strings for the column names under the variable `Column_Name`. The actual input is a dictionary-like object named `Columns` containing `{'rows': [{'Column Name': '...'}, ...], 'identifierColumn': 'Column Name'}`. The code needs to be updated to correctly extract the column names from this structure.

### 3. Specific Recommendations
To fix the tool, you must modify the Python function to stop using `pandas` and instead implement custom logic to parse the provided text string format. You also need to correct how the input parameters are handled.

Here are the specific steps:

1.  **Update Function Signature and Input Handling:**
    *   Change the function signature to match the input parameter names: `def extract_function(Columns, Excel_File):`.
    *   Extract the list of column names from the `Columns` data object. A robust way is to use the provided `identifierColumn`.

2.  **Implement Custom Text Parsing:**
    *   Use regular expressions or string splitting to break the `Excel_File` string into separate worksheets based on the `=== Sheet: ... ===` delimiter.
    *   For each worksheet, extract its name from the delimiter.
    *   The first line of each worksheet's content is the header row. Split this line by the tab character (`\t`) to get a list of column names for that sheet.
    *   Iterate through the columns you are searching for and check if they exist in the header list of the current sheet.
    *   Build a dictionary mapping each found column to its worksheet name.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
import re

def extract_function(Columns, Excel_File):
    """
    Identifies the worksheet name for each specified column in an Excel file's text representation.

    Args:
        Columns (dict): A data object containing the column names to search for.
                        Expected format: {'rows': [{'Column Name': 'name1'}, ...]}
        Excel_File (str): The text content of the Excel file, with sheets
                          delimited by '=== Sheet: [SheetName] ==='.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are column names and values are their
              respective worksheet names. If a column is not found in any
              worksheet, its value will be None.
              Returns a dictionary with an 'error' key if an issue occurs.
    """
    # 1. Validate and extract input column names from the data object
    if not isinstance(Columns, dict) or 'rows' not in Columns:
        return {"error": "Invalid format for 'Columns' input. Expected a data object with a 'rows' key."}
    
    try:
        identifier = Columns.get('identifierColumn', 'Column Name')
        column_names_to_find = [row[identifier] for row in Columns['rows']]
    except (KeyError, TypeError):
        return {"error": f"Could not extract column names from the 'Columns' input using identifier '{identifier}'."}

    # 2. Validate Excel file input is a string
    if not isinstance(Excel_File, str):
        return {"error": "Excel_File input must be a string."}

    # 3. Initialize the results dictionary with None for all columns
    results = {col_name: None for col_name in column_names_to_find}
    
    # 4. Parse the Excel file text content using the sheet delimiter
    # The regex re.split keeps the delimiter (the sheet name) in the resulting list
    sheets_data = re.split(r'===\sSheet:\s(.*?)\s===', Excel_File)
    
    if len(sheets_data) < 2:
        return {"error": "Could not find any sheet delimiters '=== Sheet: ... ===' in the Excel file content."}

    # The split results in [content_before_first_sheet, sheet_name_1, content_1, sheet_name_2, content_2, ...]
    # We iterate through this list, taking the sheet name and its content in pairs.
    for i in range(1, len(sheets_data), 2):
        sheet_name = sheets_data[i].strip()
        sheet_content = sheets_data[i+1].strip()
        
        if not sheet_content:
            continue

        # The first line of content is the header
        header_line = sheet_content.split('\n', 1)[0]
        
        # Columns in the header are typically tab-separated in this text format
        header_columns = [h.strip() for h in header_line.split('\t')]
        
        # Check which of the requested columns are in this sheet's header
        for col_name in column_names_to_find:
            # If the column is found and we haven't already found it in a previous sheet
            if col_name in header_columns and results[col_name] is None:
                results[col_name] = sheet_name
            
    return results
```

### 4. Expected Outcome
After applying the recommended fixes, the tool should correctly parse the text input and return a JSON object that maps each requested column to the name of the first worksheet where it was found.

Based on the provided test inputs, the corrected output should be:

```json
{
  "Annual Pre-6.4.1988 GMP Component At Date Of This Valuation": "New_Pensioners",
  "Date Of Exit From Active Service": "New_Pensioners",
  "Date Of Birth": "New_Pensioners",
  "Date Pensionable Service Commenced": "Active deferreds",
  "Code For Previous Status": "New_Pensioners"
}
```
