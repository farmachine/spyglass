RULES COMPLIANCE:

Our policy states that company names containing 'Inc.' require additional verification as they may indicate potential entity ambiguity. The extracted value 'Asana, Inc.' from document 'Document Name' (found in sections: Header, Agreement Terms, Signature Block) contains 'Inc.' which has triggered this validation rule. Please verify this is the correct entity and not a subsidiary or related company.
• Value appears consistent with document context

SUGGESTED RESOLUTION:
Please verify the following with the document provider:

1. Is 'Asana, Inc.' the correct primary entity for this contract/agreement?
2. Are there any subsidiary or parent companies that should be referenced instead?
3. Should this field contain the full legal entity name or a simplified version?
4. Are there any specific naming conventions your organization uses for this entity?

RECOMMENDED QUESTIONS TO ASK:
• "Can you confirm that 'Asana, Inc.' is the correct company name for this document?"
• "Are there any related entities (subsidiaries, parent companies) that might be more appropriate?"
• "Should we use a different version of this company name for consistency?"
