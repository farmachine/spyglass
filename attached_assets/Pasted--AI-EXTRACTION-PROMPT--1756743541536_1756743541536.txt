📝 AI EXTRACTION PROMPT:
================================================================================
=== TOOL FUNCTION ===
```text
For each `List Item`, use the `AI Query` against the `Reference Document` to extract relevant information and validate its accuracy. Return a JSON ARRAY of objects, where each object corresponds to a `List Item` and contains the following keys:

*   **extractedValue**: The actual data extracted from the `Reference Document` based on the `AI Query` for the corresponding `List Item`. If no relevant information can be found, return "N/A".
*   **validationStatus**: A string indicating whether the extracted value is "valid" or "invalid". A "valid" status indicates high confidence in the extracted value based on the `Reference Document` and `AI Query`. An "invalid" status should be assigned when confidence is low or no relevant information is found.
*   **aiReasoning**: A detailed explanation of the AI's reasoning process for extracting the `extractedValue`, including how the `AI Query` was applied to the `Reference Document` and why the `validationStatus` was assigned.
*   **confidenceScore**: A numerical score between 0 and 100 representing the AI's confidence in the accuracy of the `extractedValue`. A higher score indicates higher confidence.
*   **documentSource**: A string specifying the exact source (e.g., page number, section title) within the `Reference Document` from which the `extractedValue` was obtained. If the information is derived from multiple sources within the document, list all relevant sources separated by commas. If no relevant source is found, return "N/A".

The JSON ARRAY MUST use the identifierID from the input `List Item` array. This is CRUCIAL for proper record linkage and batch processing. Each object in the array corresponds to the `List Item` with the same identifierId the input list. So make sure to output each item with the same identifierId as its corresponding input. This important for updating the existing records properly.
```

=== INPUT VALUES ===

**AI Query**: Map the values to the equivalent in the the standard fields mapping document. If you can't find a sensible mapping, just say 'Not Found'. Do not just copy the column value... The result needs to be the closest matching field name in the standard mappings documents i.e. the field name verbatim. Do not just modify the column name according to the document.
