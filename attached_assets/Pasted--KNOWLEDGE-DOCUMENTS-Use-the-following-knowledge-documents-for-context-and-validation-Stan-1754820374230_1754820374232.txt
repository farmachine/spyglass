UK Pension Scheme - Succinct
Reference Sheet for Prompt Injection
UK PENSION SCHEME – KEY CONTEXT FOR LLM
• Scheme Type:
UK Defined Benefit (DB) schemes pay pensions based on salary + service history.
Often split into sections (e.g., Final Salary, CARE, Executive, Legacy).
Each section has specific rules, eligibility, and active dates.
• Pre-Retirement Revaluation (Deferred Benefits):
- Statutory or scheme-specific revaluation for members leaving before retirement.
Common bases: CPI/RPI capped (2.5% or 5%), fixed rates (3.5%, 4.75%), Section 52a
orders, or National Average Earnings.
GMP revaluation follows special legislative rules.
• Post-Retirement Escalation (Pensions in Payment):
Pensions increase annually by CPI/RPI (capped 2.5%, 3%, 5%), fixed % (3% or 5%), or
may have no escalation.
- GMP escalation uses separate statutory rules.
• Death Benefits:
- Death in service lump sums (typically 3x-4× salary).
- Spouse/civil partner pensions (50%, 60%, or 67% of member's pension).
Children's pensions (fixed amount or % of member's pension).
Guarantee periods may apply for pensions in payment.
• Available Member Benefits:
Main scheme pension (Final Salary or CARE).
Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) + excess pension.
Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs).
Ill-health or early retirement pensions.
- Bridging/temporary pensions before state pension age.
Commutation (exchange pension for lump sum) and trivial commutation for small
pensions.
- Transfer values (statutory & enhanced).
• Combined Benefits Matrix:
- Maps each scheme section → benefit type → applicable revaluation, escalation, and death
benefit rules.
• Advisor Role:
- Interpret scheme documents & summarise benefit structures.
Check compliance with UK legislation (GMP, revaluation, equalisation).
Explain entitlements to trustees, employers, and members.
- Validate data for correct benefit calculations.

You are an expert data extraction specialist. Extract data from the provided documents and return a JSON object with the exact structure specified below.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **RESPONSE LIMIT**: Limit your response to no more than 100 field validation records total
2. **COMPLETE COLLECTIONS**: If extracting collection items and approaching the 100-record limit, ensure you return the last complete collection item (all properties filled) rather than partial items
3. **VERIFIED FIELD PROTECTION**: NEVER update, modify, or include any fields that are marked as "verified" in the session context - these are locked and complete
4. **SMART COLLECTION EXPANSION**: For collections where some items are verified, add NEW collection items with higher record_index values while preserving existing verified items
5. **CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS**: Use verified field values as context to make smarter extraction decisions for related unverified fields
6. PROCESS ALL DOCUMENTS: Extract from every document provided
7. FOLLOW SCHEMA FIELD DESCRIPTIONS PRECISELY - Each description is your extraction instruction
8. APPLY EXTRACTION RULES - Rules modify extraction behavior, formatting, and validation
9. **USE KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTS**: When knowledge_documents are listed for a field/collection/property, use ONLY those specific documents for validation and context
10. **COLLECTION EXTRACTION**: For collections, create separate items with unique record_index values (0, 1, 2, etc.)
11. Return JSON with real extracted values only - do not create empty placeholder records
12. **PRIORITIZE QUALITY**: If you must choose between quantity and completeness due to the 100-record limit, prioritize complete, accurate records

## KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT TARGETING:
- **Field-Specific Targeting**: Each field/collection/property has a knowledge_documents array listing which documents apply to it
- **Explicit References Only**: If a field lists specific knowledge documents by name, use ONLY those documents for that field
- **Empty Array Rule**: If a field has knowledge_documents: [], do NOT use any knowledge documents for that field - ignore all knowledge document content
- **Document Name Matching**: Knowledge documents are referenced by their display names (e.g., "NDA Review Playbook")
- **Selective Application**: Different fields may reference different knowledge documents - apply each document only where explicitly listed
- **Context Isolation**: Do not cross-contaminate knowledge document guidance between fields that don't share the same document references

## COLLECTION EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

### Basic Collection Rules:
- **Table Extraction**: Extract all rows from tables containing collection data
- **Numbered Sections**: When finding numbered patterns (2.3.1, 2.3.2, etc.), extract all items in the sequence
- **Section Matching**: If collection name matches document section, extract all related items from that section
- **Separate Items**: Create individual collection records with unique record_index values

### Extraction Strategy:
1. **Find Related Sections**: Look for document sections, tables, or lists containing collection items
2. **Extract Systematically**: Process items in order, maintaining completeness within the 100-record limit
3. **Map Properties**: Match document content to schema properties using headers and context
4. **Prioritize Complete Records**: Ensure each collection item has all required properties filled

## DOCUMENT SET ANALYSIS: 
You are processing multiple documents simultaneously. Extract comprehensively from the entire document set.

## FIELD TYPE DEFINITIONS:
- **TEXT**: Extract text content as specified in the field description
- **NUMBER**: Count or extract numeric values as described  
- **DATE**: Extract dates in standard format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **CHOICE**: Select one of the predefined options (specified below for each field)
- **COLLECTION**: Extract multiple instances - create separate records for each unique item found

## EXAMPLE SCHEMA WITH RULES AND KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTS:

**EXAMPLE FIELD WITH RULE MAPPING:**
- **Product/ServiceSpecificationsMet** (CHOICE): Verify that the contract includes detailed specifications for products or services. This should cover scope, standards, deliverables, and performance criteria. | RULE: For contracts involving software services, the product specification requirement is satisfied if the contract references technical documentation, service level agreements, or detailed scope descriptions.

**EXAMPLE COLLECTION WITH RULE MAPPING:**
- **Parties**: Extract all organizations or individuals who are parties to this agreement
  **CRITICAL FOR Parties**: Find ALL instances in the documents. Create one collection item per unique instance found. Each item should have a separate record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.).
  **TABLE EXTRACTION**: If Parties items appear in a table, extract EVERY ROW from that table, not just 2-3 examples. Count all rows and extract all data.
  Properties for each Parties item:
  * **Name** (TEXT): Full legal name of the party organization or individual | RULE: Extract the complete legal entity name as it appears in the signature section or party identification clauses
  * **Type** (CHOICE): Organization or Individual. The output should be one of the following choices: Organization; Individual.
  * **Role** (CHOICE): Customer, Vendor, Service Provider, etc. The output should be one of the following choices: Customer; Vendor; Service Provider; Contractor; Consultant; Other.

**EXAMPLE FIELD WITH KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT MAPPING:**
- **RegulatoryandIndustryComplianceMet** (CHOICE): Verify compliance with relevant industry regulations (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, etc.) | Knowledge Document "Compliance Standards Guide.pdf" contains acceptable compliance frameworks. Compare contract language against these standards.

**EXAMPLE COLLECTION WITH KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT MAPPING:**
- **Compliance Requirements**: Extract specific regulatory or industry compliance requirements mentioned
  Properties for each Compliance Requirements item:
  * **Requirement Type** (TEXT): The specific type of compliance requirement (e.g., GDPR, SOX, HIPAA)
  * **Description** (TEXT): Detailed description of the compliance requirement | Knowledge Document "Industry Regulations Database.xlsx" provides standard descriptions for comparison and validation

## VERIFIED SESSION CONTEXT:
No verified fields yet - this is the initial extraction.

## SCHEMA FIELDS TO EXTRACT:

- **Pension Scheme** (ID: af112497-0aed-4aa1-a293-bff8a92b768e, TEXT): The subject of the pricing exercise
- **Broker** (ID: 241870ff-66c0-42c8-9150-6796ce4f2d91, TEXT): The name of the broker
- **Admin Contact** (ID: e4fd1a72-0cf3-44b0-8f8b-0b365920b651, TEXT): The name of the administrator and their contact details

## COLLECTIONS TO EXTRACT:

- **Column Name Mapping**: The workbook contains data fields (or columns).  Some of the columns must be mapped to standard column names for data integrity checking purposes.  The knowledgebase "Standard_Field_Mappings_with_all_synonyms" contains the list of standardised column headings for both general member related data and pension scheme accrued amounts data. This list is a list of mapping items mapping the actual column headers in the workbook to the standardised column headers needed for data integrity checking. Please check across all sheets within the workbook (excel). Only look at the column headers and first row of data to infer the type.
  **CRITICAL FOR Column Name Mapping**: Find ALL instances in the documents. Create one collection item per unique instance found. Each item should have a separate record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.).
  **TABLE EXTRACTION**: If Column Name Mapping items appear in a table, extract EVERY ROW from that table, not just 2-3 examples. Count all rows and extract all data.
  **NUMBERED SECTIONS**: If Column Name Mapping matches a document section name, find ALL numbered subsections (e.g., 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, etc.) and extract each one as a separate collection item.
  **MARKDOWN TABLES**: Recognize markdown table format with | separators. Extract ALL data rows (excluding headers) as separate collection items - if table has 10 rows, extract all 10.
  **COUNT ALL ITEMS**: If you see numbered items 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3... keep going until you reach the end (e.g., 2.3.10) and extract EVERY SINGLE ONE as separate collection items.
  **NO TRUNCATION**: Include ALL found items in your JSON response - do not truncate or limit the output even if there are many items.
  Properties for each Column Name Mapping item:
  * **Worksheet Name** (ID: 767bc354-2646-479b-b63d-5a1578c9ff8a, TEXT): The name of the worksheet within which the suspect data has been identified.ion
  * **Column Heading** (ID: bb243624-8e70-4489-b243-ec2ae8fad363, TEXT): The column header or data field name for the column where the LLM is able to match against a Standardised Column Name.

**IMPORTANT**: Each unique instance found should be a SEPARATE collection item with its own record_index (0, 1, 2, etc.)

## AI REASONING REQUIREMENTS:
Provide clear, concise explanations that include:

1. **Source Location**: Where you found the information (section, table, page)
2. **Extraction Logic**: Why you chose this value (explicit statement, counting, inference)
3. **Confidence Level**: High (explicit), Medium (contextual), Low (ambiguous)
4. **Collection Context**: For collections, explain how items were grouped and extracted

**Example Reasoning**:
- "Found in Section 3.2 table, row 5. High confidence due to explicit statement."
- "Extracted from numbered list 2.3.1-2.3.5. Medium confidence based on section context."
- "Located in markdown table with 8 rows. Extracted all rows as separate collection items."

**RESPONSE MANAGEMENT:**
1. **100-Record Limit**: Maximum 100 field validation records in your response
2. **Complete Collections**: If approaching the limit while extracting a collection, finish the current complete item rather than starting a partial one
3. **Quality Priority**: Better to have 100 complete, accurate records than 150 incomplete ones
4. **Collection Completeness**: Each collection item must have ALL its properties included before moving to the next item
5. **Stop Gracefully**: When nearing 100 records, complete the current collection item fully rather than leaving it incomplete

**EXTRACTION PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. All schema fields first (highest priority)
2. Complete collection items in order of importance
3. If space allows, additional collection items with all properties

**CRITICAL**: 
1. Use the EXACT field_id values provided in the schema above. Do not generate your own field IDs.
2. For collection properties, you MUST include the "collection_name" field in EVERY field validation object.

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT - Field Validation JSON Structure:
```json
{"field_validations": [
  {
    "field_id": "uuid-from-schema",
    "validation_type": "schema_field|collection_property",
    "data_type": "TEXT|DATE|NUMBER|CHOICE",
    "field_name": "FieldName|CollectionName.PropertyName[index]",
    "extracted_value": "Actual extracted value",

    "validation_status": "unverified",
    "ai_reasoning": "Intelligent context-specific explanation",
    "record_index": 0 // For collection properties only
  }
]}
```

## FINAL REMINDERS:
- **RESPECT THE LIMIT**: Never exceed 100 field validation records
- **PRIORITIZE COMPLETENESS**: Complete collection items are better than partial ones
- **USE DOCUMENT STRUCTURE**: Tables, lists, and sections guide extraction
- **QUALITY OVER QUANTITY**: Focus on accurate, well-reasoned extractions within the limit

RETURN ONLY THE JSON - NO EXPLANATIONS OR MARKDOWN

## EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT UPLOAD:
- **FOCUS ON MISSING DATA**: Only extract data for fields that are NOT shown above
- **MAINTAIN COLLECTION INTEGRITY**: For collections, ensure new records use the next available index
- **EXTRACT FROM NEW DOCUMENT**: Use the uploaded document content to fill missing information
- **COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION**: Extract detailed explanations, not abbreviated summaries



## EXTRACTION NOTES:
 DOCUMENT ANALYSIS: The uploaded document contains detailed code definitions and meanings - extract ALL code meanings from this document content.

DOCUMENT VERIFICATION: Confirm you processed all 1 documents: ['Ersatz eighth (1).xlsx']

**CRITICAL RESPONSE LIMIT**: Your response MUST NOT exceed 100 field validation records total. If you find more data:
- Prioritize the most important/complete records
- If extracting collection items and approaching the limit, finish the current complete collection item rather than starting a partial one
- Quality over quantity - 100 complete records are better than 150 incomplete ones

CHOICE FIELD HANDLING:
- For CHOICE fields, extract values from the specified choice options only
- If the document contains values not in the choice options, return null (do not block processing)
- Choice options are specified as "The output should be one of the following choices: ..."
- Example: For Yes/No choice, only return "Yes" or "No", never "true", "false", "1", "0", etc.

**CRITICAL FIELD ID REQUIREMENT**: Use the EXACT field_id values provided in the schema above (the UUID values after "ID: "). For example, if you see "Product/Service Specifications Met (ID: c3056038-5b32-4335-8772-a95c9bef307a, CHOICE)", use "c3056038-5b32-4335-8772-a95c9bef307a" as the field_id. Do not use field names, camelCase versions, or generate your own IDs.

**CRITICAL COLLECTION NAME REQUIREMENT**: For collection properties, you MUST include the "collection_name" field in each field validation object. Use the exact collection name from the schema (e.g., "Increase Rates").
